Standalone Regolith desktop environment for Arch Linux

This is a PKGBUILD for Regolith Linux's fork of the i3 (plus Gnome-flashback) window manager/desktop environment, to rather hackily rip the desktop environment for Regolith Linux and make it work on Arch Linux and it's derivatives. 

Given that Regolith is based on Ubuntu, this will likely only be updated when new releases come out (20.04, 20.10, etc.), barring of course something breaks. But package versions will be taken from the "Release" branch of the Regolith PPA repo, as opposed to "Stable," "Unstable," or "Experimental." If that changes, it'll be noted in the README.

Where possible (more accurately, where I've found possible), Arch/AUR packages will be used if compatible versions exist. 

IF THIS MESSAGE IS STILL PRESENT, IT IS NOT READY FOR PRIME-TIME. EITHER DON'T TRY IT AT ALL, OR TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK. THERE IS NO WARRANTY. When I and anyone else working on this decide that it's ready, we will make it available in the AUR. 

Credit to Kevin Gilmer @kgilmer for the creation of Regolith Linux as well as invaluable insight during the creation of this PKGBUILD. 
Pull requests are welcome, the number of packages here is enormous (it is a full desktop environment, after all), and this is my first software/package management project of any kind.
